# üèãÔ∏è Workout Tracker ‚Äì Full Stack Fitness Progression App

A full-stack Java (Spring Boot) + FastAPI + React.ts application to log and visualize workout sessions, track progress over time, and get progress insights.

---

## ‚úÖ Current Features

### Backend (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)
- User registration and login with **JWT authentication**
- Exercise database preloaded with 1000+ entries with various muscle groups
- Secure **API endpoints** for:
    - Fetching filtered/unfiltered exercises
    - Logging workouts tied to authenticated users
    - Retrieving workout history per user
- **Caffeine caching** for improved performance (65% throughput gain on GET `/api/exercises`)
- Clean RESTful architecture with DTO projection to limit unnecessary data transfer

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- Authentication system with login/register pages
- JWT token storage in `localStorage` and context-based auth state
- Dashboard:
    - Greeting for logged-in user
    - Workout history display (linked to user)
    - Add new workout form 

### Performance Benchmarking
- Integrated **k6** scripts for load testing API endpoints
- Compared performance before and after caching

---

## üöß Ongoing Development

- **User dashboard analytics** (reps/week, most worked muscles, progress curve)
- Integration with local **Python microservice (gRPC)** for ML-based insights

## Setup Instructions

### üì¶ Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker + Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (or let Docker run it)

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/workout-tracker.git
   cd workout-tracker/backend
   ```
2. Run PostgreSQL in Docker (if not installed locally):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   You can find the `docker-compose.yml` in the root directory to set up PostgreSQL.
3. Configure `application.properties` with your DB credentials
    ```ini
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/workoutdb
    spring.datasource.username=postgres
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   ```
4. Build and run the Spring Boot app:
   ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
